  '''  
    The code above is a Streamlit app that fetches stock data using the  yfinance  library, calculates moving averages, and displays an interactive chart using Plotly. It also uses the  Prophet  library to predict stock prices for the next 180 days. 
    To run the Streamlit app, save the code to a file named  app.py  and run the following command in the terminal: 
    streamlit run app.py
    
    This will start a local server and open the app in your default web browser. You can enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, NVDA) and click the "Fetch Data" button to see the stock data, moving averages, and price predictions. 
    Conclusion 
    In this tutorial, we learned how to use the  Prophet  library to forecast time series data in Python. We covered the key concepts behind Prophet and demonstrated how to use it to predict stock prices. 
    Prophet is a powerful tool for time series forecasting and is particularly useful for business applications. It is easy to use and provides accurate predictions with minimal configuration.
